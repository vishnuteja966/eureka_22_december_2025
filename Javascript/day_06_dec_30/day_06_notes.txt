HigherOrder functions
=====================
-Functions which has either of the below 2 properties are called HigherOrder
    1. function returns another function
    2. function takes another function as argument


CallBack Function : The function that is being passed as argument to a higherOrder function
HigherOrder : The function that takes a callback function as arguement



closure
=======
-A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. 

-A closure is a concept where an inner function has access to its outer function's variables even after the outer function's execution is Completed/Closed.

-When an inner function accesses any data from the outer function, a 'closure' scope gets attached to the inner function.
 hence inner function can access outer function data.

-When the outer function execution completes, we would expect all its variables to be no longer accessible. However, if the inner function uses variables from the outer function, those variables remain accessible.

-The inner function retains access to the outer function’s scope, because the inner function ‘remembers’ the environment in which it was created.

NOte:
=====
-only inner functions will have closure Scope, outer functions will never have closure
-only the inner functions who access outer functions data, for them closure will be attached


why/where closure is being used
===============================
1. Encapsulation
2. Function Factory
