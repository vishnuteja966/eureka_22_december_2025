EventLoop
=========
Javascript Runtime Components:
Memory Heap : Area where variables are stored physically
CallStack : Where Functions Execute (LIFO)
Event Loop : keeps an eye on callstack, helps to execute tasks and microtasks queue functions


CallBacks
=========
-A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function to be executed later,
after an async task finishes.
-callbacks allow javascript to keep running while waiting for results




Promise
=======
-A Promise is an object whose value might not be available now, but will be available later some time
-Async Operations
-1. pending   2. fulfilled   3. rejected
-To get Data from promise:  1.then()   2. async await



Async-await
============
- async/await syntactic sugar over promise
- async makes a function return a promise
- await pause the execution inside async function and will go to the next line 
  only when promise is resolved/rejected
