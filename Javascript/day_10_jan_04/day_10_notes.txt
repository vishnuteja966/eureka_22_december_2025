Array Mutability/Immutability
============================
1. Even when declared as const, the elements of an array can be changed, added, or removed. However, the reference to the array cannot be reassigned.
	const arr = [1, 2, 3];
	arr[0] = 11;
	arr.push(4); // Mutating the array (allowed)
	console.log(arr); // [42, 2, 3, 4]
	// Reassigning the array (not allowed with `const`)
	arr = [5, 6, 7]; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

2. Immutability (Freezing an Array) (Object.freeze() is shallow, meaning nested objects or arrays are still mutable)
	const arr = Object.freeze([1, 2, 3]);
	arr[0] = 42; // Attempting to mutate the array
	arr.push(4); // TypeError: Cannot add property 3, object is not extensible
	console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3]
	
3. create new arrays instead of modifying existing ones. (map(), filter() , spread operator)
    const arr = [1, 2, 3];
	const newArr = [...arr, 4]; // Adds 4 without modifying the original
	console.log(newArr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
	console.log(arr);    // [1, 2, 3] (unchanged)




Array Copy
==========
let arr1 = [10, 20];
let arr2 = arr1;  // address/reference copy ( Not value copy)
-A new array is not being created, rather same address is being assigned to arr2
-Both arr1 & arr2 are holding the same address

let arr1 = [10, 20, [30, 31]];
let arr2 = [...arr1]; // value copy - shallow copy

let arr3 = [10, 20, [30, 31]];
let arr4 = structuredClone(arr3); // value copy - Deep Copy

-A shallow copy of an array is a copy whose nested elements share the same references.
 (Nested arrays will not be copied by value)
-A deep copy of an array is a copy whose nested elements do not share the same references.
